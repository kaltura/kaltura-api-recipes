# LucyBot recipes for the Kaltura API

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bobby-brennan/kaltura-recipes.git && cd kaltura-recipes
git submodule init && git submodule update # You'll need access to bobby-brennan/lucy-codegen
cd lucy-codegen && npm install && cd ..
npm install
```

## Startup
To use in development mode, run
```bash
export KALTURA_RECIPES_PORT=3000
export LUCYBOT_DEV=true
node server.js
```

To use in production, run
```bash
export KALTURA_RECIPES_PORT=443
sudo node server.js
```

You can use packages like [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) to keep the service running in the background.

```bash
npm install -g forever
forever start server.js
```

## Testing
The code for each recipe can be generated by running ```npm test```. This will start the server on
port 3334, and generate code for each recipe/language pair. The generated code will checked against
the code in ```test/golden/{language}/{recipe_name}```.

The tests will also run the generated code on port 3333 and check the output of 127.0.0.1:3333/
against golden files in ```test/golden/responses/{language}/{recipe_name}```

You can regenerate the golden files by setting

```export WRITE_GOLDEN=true```

and running

```npm test```

You can set the credentials for testing using environment variables:

```export KALTURA_PARTNER_ID=123456```

```export KALTURA_SECRET=abcd1234```
or
```export KALTURA_ADMIN_SECRET=abcd1234```

```export KALTURA_USER_ID=foo@bar.com```



To use a different service URL, you can set KALTURA_SERVICE_URL flag:

```export KALTURA_SERVICE_URL=http://my_url.com/```

You can also set this flag before starting the server to point the recipes at your own service URL.

## Overview

This repository contains tutorials - known as recipes - for working with Kaltura's API. The repository is structured as follows:
* ```recipes/``` - a set of JSON objects, each corresponding to a single tutorial.
* ```code_templates/``` - Kaltura-specific templates which are passed to the LucyBot code builders.
* ```code_templates/views/``` - HTML templates for displaying the results of the API. Views starting with ```Kaltura``` correspond to specific objects in Kaltura's API schema; e.g. ```KalturaMediaEntry.html``` is the HTML for displaying a [KalturaMediaEntry](https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/testmeDoc/index.php?object=KalturaMediaEntry). Note that files under ```code_templates/views/html/``` are used by default, but can be overriden for a specific language by placing a view with the same filename under ```code_templates/views/language_name``` (e.g. to use the jquery-fileupload library when working in javascript).
* ```code_templates/actions/``` - Templates for making calls to the API in different languages. There is a subdirectory for each language.
* ```code_templates/generic_actions/``` - There is one template in here for each supported language. These templates are special in that they don't produce working code; rather, they produce the templates that would normally be found in ```code_templates/actions/```. These templates use Kaltura's API Schema to automatically generate action templates.

Other directories control the webserver:
* ```routes/``` contains a set of Express routers, which control what paths are served by the webserver
* ```views/``` is a set of Jade templates for displaying recipes to the user
* ```static/``` contains CSS, JavaScript, and images, and are served without processing
* ```less/``` contains LESS files for generating CSS
* ```scripts/``` contains helpful scripts for doing things like compiling LESS to CSS
* ```test/``` contains the test files, along with golden files for tracking changes to the generated code.
 
Finally, the LucyBot code buildier libraries are contained in the Git Submodule ```lucy-codegen```. To update to the latest version, simply enter the directory and run ```git pull```.

## Adding a New Recipe

Recipes are controlled by the JSON files under ```recipes/```. To add a new recipe, simply create a new JSON file in that directory. JSON is structured as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "the name of this file",
  "title": "the title of the recipe",
  "icon": "the name of a fontawesome icon. Can be any one of those listed in static/bower/fontawesome/scss/_icons.scss",
  "description": "A short description of the recipe",
  
  "control_sets": "this is an array of steps for the recipe, structured as below",

          "choices": [{
            "value": "The value assigned to this field for this choice",
            "label": "A human-readable label for this choice"
          }],
          "dynamicChoices": "Similar to choices, but will use an API call to fill out the list. The API call must return an array",

              "parameters": {
                "fieldName, e.g. orderBy": "value, e.g. +createdAt",
                "fieldName": {"answers": "answerName"}
              }
            }]
          }
        }
      ],
      
    }
  ],
  "pages": "An array of single page apps to generate along side this recipe.",

    {
      "view": "The name of the main view for this recipe, e.g. KalturaMediaListResponse. The view file should reside under code_templates/views/html",
      "data": {
        "action": "The action that supplies the data for the initial load of this page"
      }
    }
  ],

  "views": [
    "myView"
  ],
  "actions": "An array of actions that are used in this recipe.",
  "actions": [{
    "service": "(optional) The name of a Kaltura service. This allows the action to be auto-generated by the templates in the generic_actions/ directory",
    "action": "The name of the action. Should be the name of a Kaltura action if service is specified",
    "view": "A view for displaying this action's output, e.g. KalturaMediaListResponse for media.list"
  }]
}
```

## Adding a new View

Views are snippets of HTML for displaying responses from the API. Any valid HTML can be used here, including ```<script>``` and ```<style>``` tags.

LucyBot also provides some helper tags:
* Use ```{{ variable.name }}``` to print the value of a given variable
* Use ```<lucy for="thing" in="array">``` to iterate over an array
* Use ```<lucy if="condition">``` to add conditionals
* Use ```<lucy if="result.message && result.code">``` to check for errors and print error messages
* Use ```<lucy include="ViewName">``` to include other views

You have access to two global variables inside of your views:
* ```result``` which is the API's response (but can be overriden via ```<lucy include>```)
* ```answers``` which contains the user's responses from inside the recipe

```<lucy include>``` can operate in two different ways:

1. It can simply copy the HTML of the included view

2. It can make a new call to the API, and use the included view as a template for displaying the result.

Case (1) is the default behavior. In addition, you can use ```<lucy include="ViewName" resultvar="foo">``` to use variable "foo" in place of API output. For example, since KalturaMediaListResponse is just an array of KalturaMediaEntry, we can have:
```html
<lucy for="video" in="result">
  <lucy include="KalturaMediaEntry" resultvar="video"></lucy>
</lucy>
```

This allows us to use the same KalturaMediaEntry template whether we're using ```media.list``` or ```media.get```.

Case (2) is useful if you need more data from the API. You can specify ```action```, which is the name of the action to use, and ```inputvars``` which is a mapping from variable names to API inputs.

If, for example, KalturaMediaListResponse was just an array of entryIds, we could do:

```html
<lucy for="entryId" in="result">
  <lucy include="KalturaMediaEntry" action="getMedia" inputvars="{id: entryId}"></lucy>
</lucy>
```

## Step by step example for adding a new recipe
The sample recipe will accept an entry ID as input and output the entry's name, ID, descrption and number of plays.

The below json file should be placed under the recipes dir

```json
{
    "name": "entry_lookup",
    "title": "Entry Lookup",
    "icon": "search",
    "description": "Learn how to get a specific entry ID using Kaltura's API",
    "control_sets": [
        {
            "inputs": [
                {
                    "default": "",
                    "type": "text",
                    "label": "Entry ID",
                    "name": "entryId"
                }
            ],
            "affects": "getMedia",
            "tip": "This is how to retrieve a single entry. Use Media Entry Filters to select which content you want to show.",
            "title": "Filtering Results"
        }
    ],
    "pages": [
        {
            "view": "KalturaSimpleEntry",
            "data": {
                "action": "getMedia"
            }
        }
    ],
    "views": [
        "KalturaSimpleEntry"
    ],
    "actions": [
        {
            "service": "media",
            "action": "get",
            "view": "KalturaSimpleEntry"
        }
    ]
}
```

The recipe uses the KalturaSimpleEntry view to display the results. The view file should be placed under: code_templates/views/html/KalturaSimpleEntry.html
```
<div id="ErrorMessage" class="alert alert-danger" style="display: none">
</div>
<lucy if="result.message && result.code">
    <h1>{{result.message}}</h1>
</lucy>
<lucy if="result.id">
  <h1>Entry Info</h1>
  <p>Name: {{ result.name }}</p>
  <p>ID: {{ result.id }}</p>
  <p>Description: {{ result.description }}</p>
  <p>Plays: {{ result.plays }}</p>
</lucy>

```
After restarting the node, the new recipe should appear on the index page.

```
"icon": "search"
```
controls which icon will be displayed. Available options are here:
```
static/bower/fontawesome/scss/_icons.scss
```
